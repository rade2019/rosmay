We need a repository in Github

1. Create a repository
what is it called - Rosmay
git init - initials our Rosmay repository
where is it located-  we have questions about this....should it be in cohert 3? 
Tracey is a little confused about how this space works....
include a README - The readme has the project organisation details

Our personal directories will be reflected in the git repository. 
instructions/  
PythonScripts/  
R-Project/

Raw data is on Pearcy blah blah...put in path name they are read only

Output data ... goes to a new file in Pearcy....output/Rosmay
Filenames, metadata file, sequencing data....they need to be processed,
there may be some intermediate outputs in here, stay flexible.  

Commits are recommended for changes in code, so we commit when we have a
 "sensible change that is decribed" 

A push or a pull is a commit to the hub, you are interchangeing what you have
done. Other people know your changes and you add to thier file. 

Where are we pushing/pulling- rosmay repository.

Communication - Commits are to the branches which we can work on 
independently or together
push is to the branch as well
When we push or pull, notify each other in slack. 

Pull Requests are the heart of collaboration on GitHub. 
When you open a pull request, you’re proposing your changes and 
requesting that someone review and pull in your contribution and 
merge them into their branch

We could each have a branch off of master for our work called 
whatever feature 1 feature 2 etc
